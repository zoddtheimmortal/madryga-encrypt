in the crypt of my soul, charly, your name resonates like a death knell 
echoing through a plague-ridden city. a grotesque effigy of beauty, you 
stalk my nightmares, your eyes hollow sockets mirroring the abyss within. 
my tongue, a leprous thing, chokes on your name, a blasphemy uttered in a charnel house.

my love for you, a cancerous growth, consumes the vestiges of my sanity. 
your absence, a gaping maw, festers in my gut, spewing forth a putrid bile of 
desolation. i am a carrion crow, circling your enigmatic form, drawn by the promise 
of carrion, oblivious to the peril of your jagged talons.

the world around me rots, a festering corpse crawling with maggots. 
its once vibrant hues have morphed into the sickly green of decay. 
only in the fleeting glimpses i steal of you, like a ghoul peering through a 
mausoleum window, do i find a perverse solace.

charly, your name a strangled curse upon my decaying lips, 
a desperate bargain struck in the coven of my shattered mind. may 
fate, that skeletal hand, grant me the macabre pleasure of feeling 
your touch, even if it be the prelude to an eternity entombed within 
your icy indifference. for you, my love, i would gladly become a thrall 
to oblivion, a willing sacrifice upon the desecrated altar of your heart.
