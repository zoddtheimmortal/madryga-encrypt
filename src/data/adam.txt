a fetid village, winden, nestled beneath the malevolent gaze of an ancient 
forest, writhes in the coils of a curse. a gaping maw in the earth, a gateway 
to a bygone age, is unearthed by nilsa, a child of innocence, unleashing a 
plague upon the land. four families, the tiedemans, dopplers, nielsens, and 
wohlers, become puppets strung on the strings of a malevolent fate, their 
lives playing out in a macabre dance across three epochs - 1888, 1921, and 
1953. a sickly yellow slicker, a harbinger of doom, haunts the generations.

a clandestine brotherhood, sic mundus, lurks in the shadows, their grubby 
fingers meddling with the very fabric of time for reasons as black as their 
hearts. h.g. tannhäuser, a stranger etched with the marks of past 
transgressions, descends upon winden in 1953, his intentions as opaque as a 
moonless night. the tapestry of time rips, spewing past and present into a 
horrifying tableau. children vanish, reappearing years later, untouched by the 
passage of time, their eyes vacant voids. a humming monstrosity, a testament 
to man's insatiable hunger for power, spews forth its toxic breath over the 
land.

jonas kahnwald, a callow youth from 1986, finds himself trapped in the 
oppressive year of 1953, his yearning for home a gnawing ache. martha 
nielsen, a forbidden bloom, becomes the object of his affection, their love a 
grotesque mockery of the natural order. bartosz tiedemann, a boy teetering on 
the precipice of madness, stumbles upon a contraption beneath the floorboards 
- a time machine, the twisted creation of his own father, the enigmatic h.g. 
tannhäuser. the noose tightens around their necks.

secrets fester like maggots in a wound. perverse desires blossom in the fetid 
darkness. sacrifices are made, offerings to a ravenous god. the very air is 
thick with the stench of impending apocalypse, a direct consequence of man's 
hubris. claudia tiedemann, a woman fueled by an unyielding rage, claws at the 
truth, desperate to unravel the secrets of winden. whispers of a "knot" that 
must be untied echo through the ages, a cryptic prophecy offering a glimmer of 
hope.

through a gauntlet of horrors, jonas fights to mend the fractured timeline, 
burdened by the knowledge that altering the past irrevocably alters the 
future. adam nielsen, a figure shrouded in enigma, emerges as the puppet 
master, his motives as inscrutable as the depths of the abyss. a final, 
desperate gambit is undertaken, a last-ditch effort to sever the chains of 
time and break the cycle of suffering. will the darkness engulf winden, or 
will a sliver of light pierce through the gloom? the answer hangs suspended, 
as fragile as a spider's web.
